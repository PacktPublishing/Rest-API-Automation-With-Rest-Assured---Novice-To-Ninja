Pytest Naming Conventions
When using pytest, it is very important to follow naming conventions.

If we don't follow naming conventions, then pytest will not pick up tests from the file.

File names should start or end with “test”, as in test_example.py or example_test.py
Class name should start with “Test”, as in TestExample
Test method names should start with “test_”, as in test_example
You can refer to the official documentation for more details:
