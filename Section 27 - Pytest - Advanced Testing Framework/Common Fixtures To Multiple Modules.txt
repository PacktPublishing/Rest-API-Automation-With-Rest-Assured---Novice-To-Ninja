Important Note For the Lecture Conftest -> Common Fixtures To Multiple Modules

In this lecture, we will be using a wildcard "*" -> Asterisk for running multiple files with one command.

Windows machine does not recognize "*" and it cannot be used on that.

If you are using Windows, then please use the full file name, instead of using wildcards.
