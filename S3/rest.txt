——————————Query Parameters vs Path Parameters———————————

• Query parameters: These are appended at the end of the RESTApi Endpoint. They can be identified by the use of ?
Example:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=imperial&origins=Washington,DC&destinations=New+York+City,NY&key=YOUR_API_KEY

• Path parameters: These are part of the RESTApi endpoint. 
Example:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/{json}?queryparameters
https://baseURI/{year}/sports

Form Parameters:
All the data from UI/Rest can go using two ways:
1. PayLoad -> Google Places
2. Form Parameters
